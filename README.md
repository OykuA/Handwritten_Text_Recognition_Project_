# Handwritten Text Recognition

This project uses Python, TensorFlow, and Flask to build a handwritten text recognition system. It supports offline recognition (OCR) and online recognition using a digital stylus. The app can classify individual handwritten characters, allowing users to add data or test the recognition in real time.
